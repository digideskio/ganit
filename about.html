                    The purpose of this project Ganit is to create a graphical equation editor for MathML. The technology at the heart of Ganit is MathML, the XML standard for representing mathematical notation. Its user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MathML so user can select and create mathematical notation.
                    We will use a graphical equation editor to build equations from predefined mathematical structural elements. This process is very dependent on the use of the mouse and keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will provide create, edit, display and accessibility of mathematical notation for websites.
                    The intended users of this software are people who have limited technical knowledge in MathML but want to publish mathematical equations on the web easily and efficiently. We have chosen the browser as the editor to make the software cross-platform, easily and widely available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ganit will be an open source project and source code will be hosted on
